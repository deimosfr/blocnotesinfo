The author and software maintainer is Darren Reed. IPFilter supports both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols, and is a stateful firewall.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>IPFilter is delivered with FreeBSD, NetBSD and Solaris 10. It used to be a part of OpenBSD, but it was removed in May 2001 due to problems with the license of IP Filter, after negotiations between Theo de Raadt and Reed broke down. At first glance, the license looks a lot like BSD Licenses, but does not allow redistribution of modified versions. Reed came back with another proposal but it was already too late. The software was removed from OpenBSD.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
