In 1965, Ken Thompson, from Bell Labs, developed an operating system that he called MULTICS (Multiplexed Information and Computing System) in order to run a game he had created, which gave birth in 1970 to the UNICS operating system (Uniplexed Information and Computing System), quickly renamed UNIX.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the time, assembly language was the only language that allowed the development of an operating system. Ken Thompson then developed a higher-level language, the B language (whose name comes from BCPL, a subset of the CPL language, itself derived from Algol, a language that was popular at the time), to facilitate the writing of operating systems. It was a weakly typed language (an untyped language, as opposed to a typed language, is a language that manipulates objects in their binary form, without any notion of type (character, integer, real, etc.)) and too dependent on the PDP-7 (the machine on which UNIX was developed) to allow UNIX to be ported to other machines. So Denis Ritchie (who was, along with Ken Thompson, one of the creators of UNIX) and Brian Kernighan improved the B language to give birth to the C language. In 1973, UNIX was rewritten entirely in C. For 5 years, the C language was limited to internal use at Bell until the day Brian Kernighan and Denis Ritchie published a first definition of the language in a book entitled &amp;ldquo;The C Programming Language&amp;rdquo;. This was the beginning of a revolution in the world of computing.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
